Need some help geting started?

First of all, try loading in some sounds to use by clicking on the
buttons with the drum pictures on them. Choose an audio file (MP3,
WAV, or OGG) to use for that sample.

If you want, you can load in samples for each of the different pieces of the drums.
They don't even have to be audio iles of drum sounds! They can be whatever you want.

Select which sample you want to use( by using the small circles below each drum)
and then click on the place in the sequence down below where you want it to play.

Once you're finished, go ahead and click "Play" to start hearing your sequence.
If you don't hear anything, it probably means you haven't yet picked a valid audio
file for some of your samples.



================================
Sections, Subdivisions and Tempo
================================
If you want to split up your song into more than one section, just use the "add section" button.
However, if you want to split all your sections into smaller pieces (and have your sounds be
closer to each other), then use the "Subdivisions" dropdown box. By default, your song will have
4 subdivisions per measure. (These are quarter notes. To use instead use 8th notes, pick 8, and
so forth.)


Your tempo is how fast the song is played. The default is 120 beats per minute, and the higher the
number you choose, the faster your song will go.



==================================================
Looping and Changing Sections for Live Performance
==================================================
When you press "play," the song will start playing whichever section you currently have selected.
This section will keep looping until you either "Stop" the song or queue up the next section.
When you press [Spacebar], you queue up the next section. For example, if Section 3 is currently
playing, and Section 4 is after it, when you press [Spacebar], Section 3 will finish palying, but then
Section 4 will immediately begin playing and looping until you repeat the process.

By doing this, you can string together whole performances, only having to press a single button whenever
you are ready to move on.
